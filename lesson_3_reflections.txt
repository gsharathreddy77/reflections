When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When we want to collabarate with other developers we have to use remote repository. Also if you want to make your project public.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because we want the code on gitHub to be working version for other collaborators to pull for themselves.
